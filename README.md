# nba_shot_chart_map
Hot Fire!! Pretty Visuals!! This code is used to generate a shot chart for NBA player Stephen Curry's shots in the 2015-16 NBA regular season. The code uses the NBA API and matplotlib library to create the chart.

## How to use this code
This code can be used to generate a shot chart for any NBA player for any NBA season.
```bash
pip install nba_api requests pandas matplotlib
```
You'll need to have the necessary libraries installed in your system. You can install them using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
Once you have the libraries installed and the API key, you can simply replace the player name, team name, season and other parameters in the shotchartdetail.ShotChartDetail() function to generate the shot chart for your desired player.

You can also modify the create_court() function to change the color and style of the basketball court.
